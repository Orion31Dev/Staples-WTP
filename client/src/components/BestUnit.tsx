      <div className="title">Unit 3 Finishes Its Statements</div>
      <p>
        This past Tuesday, Jan. 11th, Unit 3 has completed all of its statements for the We the People: The Citizens and the Constitution
        competition. This next big milestone further proves the absolute supremacy of Unit 3, which is this year’s recipient of the Unit of
        the Year Award.
      </p>
      <p>“It’s been a long journey,” says Jet Tober of Unit 3. “I’m just so proud of all of the work everyone has done.”</p>
      <p>
        Ryan Salik recalls the beginning of the 2021-2022 school year: “I was, like, so nervous that I wouldn’t be in Unit 3, ‘cause like, I
        always wanted Unit 3 and it was my dream to be in Unit 3.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Unit 3 has faced many trials and tribulations during the drafting process. At one point, they even had to read a book. Yet,
        overcoming these obstacles, Unit 3 became the first 2nd unit to finish all statements.

        We got to speak with Meredith and Clara of Unit 3 to learn more about their efficiency. Meredith noted, “we just work so well
        together because we’re the best unit. There’s not much to it besides that.”
      </p>
      <p>Clara concurs, stating that the group's “pure talent and skill” is what propelled them to success.</p>
